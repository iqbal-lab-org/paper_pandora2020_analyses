Priority:
    - Ensure pipelines and backups are running fine;
    - Run ROC pipeline with the chosen filters for all tools;
        - Running...

Tomorrow:
    - add recall_per_nb_of_samples to use the other recall measure;
    - Describe the new data in README;
        - Update the truth probes description in the README

Wednesday meeting:
    - Replot stuff in R or rename fields
    - Go through pandora1_paper issues
    - Paper writing

Fix precision_per_ref_per_clade_medaka_pandora
    * fix later

Recheck the 4way/20way run scripts

Done:
    - Add 2-SNP heatmap;
    - Add the pandora_gene_distance plots/data (FP_genes and gene_distance_plots) to the package;
    - Add 2-SNP heatmap to the package
    - Get ROC 4way with filter on illumina data;


After paper:
    * Split some plots that are too heavy
        * the recall per nb of sample plots
