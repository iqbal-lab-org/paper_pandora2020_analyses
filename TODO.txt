Priority:
    - Add the pandora_gene_distance plots/data (FP_genes and gene_distance_plots) to the package;
    - Describe these new data in README;
    - Add 2-SNP heatmap (csv data done, plot TODO);
    - Ensure pipelines and backups are running fine;
    - add recall_per_nb_of_samples to use the other recall measure;
    - rename fields
    - Run pandora analysis 4way with filter with illumina data

Fix precision_per_ref_per_clade_medaka_pandora
    * fix later

* Split some plots that are too heavy
    * the recall per nb of sample plots
