- I think the main issue in the denovo pipeline now is not actually waiting for it to finish (this is arguable,
really depends on the cluster you have, but it is not for us), but to set it up to be run. For pandora no denovo,
you just run two command lines (pandora index, pandora compare). For the denovo pipeline, you need to configure
the input data exactly as the snakemake pipeline wants, do some configuration, have a cluster, run thousands of
jobs, etc... this is a lot harder than running just 2 command lines, and I think this is really worth mentioning...
Should we do it?
	- i think that belongs on the github front page
	- explain denovo and non-denovo pipeline in README

- dedicated FTP site for the paper
	https://github.com/iqbal-lab/pandora1_paper/issues/223

- Describe the new data in README;
	- Update the truth probes description in the README

- Recheck the 4way/20way run scripts
