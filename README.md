# paper_pandora2020_analyses

Snakemake pipeline to handle the installation and running of all pipelines in the pandora paper. It also produces all
plots in the paper. 

The version used in the pandora paper has tag `pandora_paper_tag1`.

# Paper plots

If you are interested only on the paper plots package, it can be [viewed here](scripts/csv_to_paper_plots/paper_pandora2020_plots)
or [downloaded here](https://github.com/leoisl/pandora1_paper_full_pipeline/raw/master/scripts/csv_to_paper_plots/paper_pandora2020_plots.zip).

# Running

## Requirements

### Dependencies
* python 3.6+;
* singularity 2.4.1+;

## Setting up the installation pipeline (do this if you want to run the pipeline)
```
cd installation_pipeline && ./setup.sh
```

## Running on the paper data on an LSF cluster (on 20-way):

1. `git checkout pandora_paper_tag1`
2. `scripts/submit_lsf.sh <input_data_folder> <pipeline_output>`

## Running on the paper data on an LSF cluster (on 4-way):

1. `git checkout pandora_paper_tag1`
2. `scripts/submit_lsf_4_way.sh <input_data_folder> <pipeline_output>`

## Packaging 20- and 4-way results

Scripts `scripts/package_output.sh` and `scripts/package_output_4way.sh` package the 20- and 4-way results, respectively,
computed with the previous commands. It creates two zip packages, `pandora1_paper_analysis_output_20_way.zip` and
`pandora1_paper_analysis_output_4_way.zip`, respectively, containing the data that is needed to reproduce the paper plots 
(and some other additional data).

## Reproducing all plots in the paper from pre-computed results:

The two previously described packages were already pre-computed and made available. To download, extract, and use them 
to create the plots in the paper, please do:

1. `git checkout pandora_paper_tag1`
2. `cd scripts/csv_to_paper_plots && ./generate_paper_plots.sh`


# Package files description

The `pandora1_paper_analysis_output_20_way.zip` package contains data that 
can be reprocessed and replotted. Besides the data, some plots are also included to give a general sense/idea of the data,
and how the plots could look like, but it is by no means the best visualisation of the data. 
In what follows is a short description of each file and its fields, to help on the understanding of the files in these 
packages.

## Preliminaries

### The different types of recall
In many plots regarding recall, we have different ways to measure recall. It is easier to explain them using examples.
Suppose we have three genes, each with one SNP between them. The first gene is rare, present in 2/20 genomes.
The second gene is at an intermediate frequency, in 10/20 genomes.
The third is a strict core gene, present in all genomes.
The SNP in the first gene has alleles `A`, `C` at 50% frequency (1 `A` and 1 `C`).
The SNP in the second gene has alleles `G`, `T` at 50% frequency (5 `G`s and 5 `T`s).
The SNP in the third gene has alleles `A`, `T` with 15 `A`s and 5 `T`s.
Suppose a variant caller found the SNP in the first gene, detecting the two correct alleles.
For the second geneâ€™s SNP, it detected only one `G` and one `T`, failing to detect either allele in the other 8 genomes.
For the third gene's SNP, it detected all the 5 `T`s, but no `A`. Here, the:

* Total Allelic Recall (`TAR`, referenced as `recall_wrt_truth_probes` in the files) would be 
`number of alleles found / number of total alleles = (2+2+5)/(2+10+20) = 0.28`. The main issue with `TAR` is that core
variants contribute to a lot more alleles, and thus weight, in the recall calculation than rare variants. For example,
if we are in a panel with 20 genomes, one core variant can have the same weight as 10 rare variants. This means that our
recall measurement is biased towards tools that recover core variants well. For this reason, this measure is generally
not considered in the paper, except when it is needed to compute recall restricted to single samples (which is the only
measure defined in this case). To deal with this core variant bias, we have two other measures.

* Pan-Variant Recall (`PVR`, referenced as `recall_wrt_variants_where_all_allele_seqs_were_found` in the files) would be:
`(1 + 1 + 0) / 3 = 0.66` - i.e. score a `1` if both alleles are found, irrespective of how often, and `0` otherwise. 
This measure gives the same weight for core and rare variants.

* Average Allelic Recall (`AvgAR`, referenced as `recall_wrt_variants_found_wrt_alleles`) would be:
`(2/2 + 2/10 + 5/20) / 3 = 0.48` - i.e. for each variant, the `number of alleles found / total number of alleles`. 
This is a balance between the two previous measures. It does not overweight core variants (all variants have a
recall value in `[0, 1]`), and it rewards tools finding more alleles of a variant.

For more details, please see the paper manuscript.

## Sequencing-technology-dependent analyses

These folders/files refer to sequencing-technology-dependent analyses, present in the folders
`illumina_analysis`, `illumina_analysis_with_filters`, `nanopore_analysis`, and `nanopore_analysis_with_filters`.
For details about the filters applied in these results, see the Methods section in the paper manuscript.

## enrichment_of_FPs

Provides for each tool and sample, the error rate the pipeline computed for that tool on that sample. Can be mainly used
to check if there is a sample with issue (i.e. a sample where all tools consistently perform bad). These values are not filtered by genotype confidence.

## recall_per_ref_per_clade

Same as [precision_per_ref_per_clade](#precision_per_ref_per_clade), but for recall instead of precision.
The recall considered here is the Total Allelic Recall (`recall_wrt_truth_probes`), as it is the only defined for a single sample.

## recall_per_ref_per_nb_of_samples_per_clade

Similar to [recall_per_ref_per_clade](#recall_per_ref_per_clade), but we have data split by frequency (or number of samples) the
allele of the pangenome variant is in. The field `nb_of_samples` represent this.

Main files: `recall_per_ref_per_nb_of_samples_per_clade.{tool}_pandora.nb_of_samples_{nb}.csv` , tool == `snippy` or `samtools` or `medaka` or `nanopolish` , `nb` ranges from 2 to 20;

## precision_per_sample

The input csv for this (`precision_per_sample.tsv`) is actually the same as [enrichment_of_FPs](#enrichment_of_FPs).
Just the plots are different. Could well be merged.

Main file: `precision_per_sample.tsv`

## recall_per_sample

Similar to [precision_per_sample](#precision_per_sample). It features all the three types of recall discussed on
[The different types of recall](#the-different-types-of-recall). These values are not filtered by genotype confidence.
