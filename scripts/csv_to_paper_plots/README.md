Scripts that transform the csv data output by the pandora analysis pipeline into plots that will be in the paper.

Work in progress. For now let's just add the scripts here. In the end, we will have a main script that will be able to
produce all plots given the csv data, as:

`./produce_paper_plots.sh <dir_with_20_way_csv_data> <dir_with_4_way_csv_data>`

For the latest 20- and 4-way analysis packages, please refer to https://github.com/iqbal-lab/pandora1_paper/issues/208
